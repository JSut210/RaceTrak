# RaceTrak

I developed the RaceTrak personal lap timer as a cheaper alternative to the TBS Lap timer. 

## Features

- Fully compadible with any wifi-enabled device with browser
- Does not require any apps or additional software
- Integrated 18650 battery for 6 hours of race tracking
- Integrated USB charging via micro USB port
- Full 40ch 5.8Ghz spectrum
- Built in band scanning mode (see below)

## Where to buy

The RaceTrak personal lap timer hardware is still in prototype stages. More info will be posted when the device is ready for production!

## Getting Started

To turn on the RaceTrak lap timer, hold the main button down for 3 seconds. You will will see the LED indicator turn solid blue. In a few moments, the RaceTrak lap timer will initalize a Wifi Access point named: "RaceTrak_XXXXXXXX" where the Xs represent the ID of the product. Simply connect to this network using any device with a web browser. The user interface is optimised for mobile users, so an Android or iPhone is reccomended.

To acces the RaceTrak application, open a web browser and navigate to 192.168.1.1 Note, because you are connected to the RaceTrak wifi, you can actually use any web address you like, the RaceTrak DNS server will redirect you to 192.168.1.1 you can see the url thisdoesnnotmatter.com works just fine.
